Project Title: Comprehensive Sales Data Analysis and Insights Using Python and Visualization Tools
Project Description:
I recently completed a data analysis project focused on uncovering sales trends, customer patterns, and product performance using a real-world sales dataset. This project involved an in-depth exploration of various business dimensions such as product categories, fulfillment methods, sales trends, and customer demographics. I utilized tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform detailed analysis and visualizations, which allowed me to derive actionable insights.

Key Highlights of the Analysis:

Product Performance Analysis:

Identified the top 5 performing product categories based on quantity sold and revenue generated.
Analyzed the distribution of product categories and their respective performances.
Explored correlations between product size and quantity sold, revealing how product size impacts sales volume.
Evaluated which product styles generate the most sales in terms of quantity and amount.
Sales Trends:

Conducted time series analysis to understand weekly, monthly, and yearly sales trends.
Detected seasonal and monthly patterns in sales amounts, helping to identify peak sales periods.
Calculated the average quantity sold and revenue generated per day to understand daily sales performance.
Customer Demographics:

Analyzed the distribution and percentage of B2B vs. non-B2B sales.
Compared B2B vs. non-B2B sales across product categories, highlighting which categories perform better in each segment.
Examined the fulfillment methods used for B2B versus non-B2B sales, providing insights into preferred delivery options.
Fulfilment and Courier Status Analysis:

Investigated the distribution of fulfillment methods used across all sales.
Analyzed how different courier statuses (e.g., delayed, returned, canceled) impact sales amounts and frequencies.
Sales Quantity and Revenue Analysis:

Explored the distribution of sales quantities across all products to detect any outliers.
Examined the total sales amount distribution across different product categories.
Assessed the relationship between product size and total sales revenue, uncovering whether product size significantly influences sales.
This project helped me deepen my understanding of data analysis and visualization techniques, reinforcing my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. It was an exciting journey of discovery, and I am looking forward to applying these learnings to future business problems.
